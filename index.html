          With the technology growth, people received almost endless
          possibilities of how they can show their creativity in new ways using
          tools they've never used before. In the last few decades engineers and
          artists invented a lot of different tools which can be used for
          creating art pieces. The most powerful of course are Adobe programs
          such as Illustrator and Photoshop used mostly on laptops as well as
          Procreate or Autodesk Sketchbook for Ipad. It's amazing what you can
          do having only a laptop/tablet and some free time. As for me I mostly
          like Procreate as it's very simple and at the same time very powerful.
          You can draw from any place in the world without taking tons of paints
          and paper with you and without having a comfortable desk.
          <br /><br />But of course, the most important part of it is not about
          the technology but the way you can show your thoughts and relax
          through drawing. It's a very meditative process of creating a story or
          just a memory postcard. It's about those moments when you have your
          space alone with yourself and you can imagine anything you want on
          your paper or tablet.

            I believe drawing can help everyone to get their inner peace and
            understand themselves in a better way.</span
